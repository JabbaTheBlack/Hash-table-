# Hash-table-C (Basic user management software)
This is an entry level user management system designed with a chained hash table.

The program contains the basic hash table functions such as creating, searching, editing and deleting entries, in this case users.
The program runs on the console and has a main and 5 other menu options accessible by the right buttons.

The hash table can hold 10,000 entries but can be modified in the Hashtable.h file under TABLE_SIZE. Each entry is flexible as they are a starting pointer of a linked list.
Upon exiting the program writes the contant of the hash table into the file and also reads it when it opens up.
